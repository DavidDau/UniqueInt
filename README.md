<h1>Unique Integers Project</h1>

<h1>Project Overview</h1>
<p>This project processes a list of integers from an input file and generates an output file containing unique integers. The integers in the output are sorted in increasing order. The project includes handling various edge cases, including invalid input, empty lines, non-integer values, and multiple integers on the same line.

The project follows strict memory and runtime efficiency requirements and avoids the use of built-in libraries for operations like sorting and list management.</p>
